# LeonieWeatherQuarkus

<p>
 To use the Weatherplugin for Leonie, it has to be with Quarkus.<br>
 To run the project, first you have to start it in the Terminal with: ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev <br>
 If you have a Windows-Machine you have to start it in the Terminal with: .\mvnw compile quarkus:dev <br>
 To get the weatherdata you can write in the Terminal: curl -w "\n" http://localhost:8080/weather 
 or you go in the Browser to the url "localhost:8080/weather".<br>
 To get the website with the weatherdata and pictures you have to go to http://localhost:8080/weather.html.<br>
 <br>
 The only "problem" which I have with this code actual is, that I can not use my own WeatherModel for the weather.html site.
